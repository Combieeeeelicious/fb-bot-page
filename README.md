## Note:
- You're in developer mode, that means that the bot only respond to accounts that have specific roles assigned within the app. To use the bot from a different account or user, Just switch to Live Mode and now your bot is ready to go ðŸ˜‰

## How to switch to Live Mode?
- Find **App Mode** then switch to Live
- Follow some requirements before you can switch to Live Mode.

**(I think it's Privacy Policy and Terms of Service requires it, Just use the facebook's privacy policy and terms of Service.)**

- You're Done
